/*
@OneToOne
Annotation:
Defines a one-to-one relationship between the Driver and User entities. Each Driver is associated with exactly one User.
Logic:
This represents the relationship between a Driver and a User. It implies that every driver has a corresponding user account, possibly storing personal details like name and contact info in the User entity.
4. @JoinColumn(name = "user_id")
Annotation:
Specifies the foreign key column (user_id) in the Driver table, linking the Driver to the User table.
Logic:
The user_id column acts as a foreign key that references the primary key (id) in the User table. This establishes the relationship between a driver and their associated user account.
5. @Column(columnDefinition = "Geometry(Point, 4326)")
Annotation:
Customizes the definition of the currentLocation column. The columnDefinition is used here to define a special column type in the database. In this case, it's defined as a geographical Point (for coordinates) using the SRID (Spatial Reference Identifier) 4326, which is a common coordinate system for GPS locations.
Logic:
This is used for storing geographical location data (latitude and longitude). The Point type, along with the SRID 4326, allows storing and querying the driverâ€™s current location using geospatial queries, making it ideal for location-based services like ride-sharing.
